Description:
Create a small web-based to-do list app where users can:

✅ Add tasks via an input form
✅ See their tasks listed on the page (DOM Manipulation)
✅ Mark tasks as completed
✅ Remove tasks
✅ Validate that tasks aren't empty or just spaces (Input Sanitization)
✅ Gracefully handle errors like empty inputs
✅ Structure your code partly with Functional Programming and partly with OOP to see the contrast
✅ Write 2-3 Jest tests for your functions (e.g., task creation or validation logic)

Features Breakdown:
Feature	Concept Applied
Add tasks via form	DOM Manipulation, Event Listeners
Prevent empty/invalid input	Input Sanitization, Conditionals
Show list of tasks	Loops, DOM updates
Mark task as complete	DOM updates, Conditional styling
Delete tasks	Event Listeners, DOM Manipulation
Use FP for pure functions	Example: Task formatting/validation
Use OOP for task manager	Example: Class with add/delete methods
Error messages on bad input	Error Handling, DOM feedback
Basic Jest tests	Test validation or task creation logic

Bonus Ideas to Extend Later:
Filter tasks: Show all, completed, or pending tasks

LocalStorage: Save tasks across page reloads

Keyboard shortcuts for adding tasks

Add confirmation before deleting tasks
