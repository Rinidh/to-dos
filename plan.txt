Description:
Create a small web-based to-do list app where users can:

✅ See their tasks listed on the page (DOM Manipulation)
✅ Mark tasks as completed with checkmark
✅ Add tasks via an input form
✅ Remove tasks upon clicking crossmark
✅ Validate that tasks aren't empty or just spaces (Input Sanitization)
✅ Gracefully handle errors like empty inputs
✅ Structure your code partly with Functional Programming and partly with OOP to see the contrast

✅ Add persistence to data by localStorage - input items, checked items etc
✅ Make responsive
✅ See chat - Write 2-3 Jest tests for your functions (e.g., task creation or validation logic)

Bonus Ideas to Extend Later:
Keyboard shortcuts for adding tasks
Filter tasks: Show all, completed, or pending tasks
Add confirmation before deleting tasks
